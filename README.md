Clay processor
==============

This code does many thing similar to the Cprocessor_adv. Few things are specific to clays and this repo is expected to completely deviate from Cprocessor_adv. Hence it is added as a separate repo and not as a branch.

Dependencies: latest libgsl (http://gnu.opencube.ca/gsl/gsl-1.16.tar.gz as of this writing)
